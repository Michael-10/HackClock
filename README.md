# HackClock

**Authors** : Michael Tanel, Henry Li, and Mitchell Mulder
## About
An alarm clock by hackers for hackers. This was a project developed during the Local Hack Day, Limestone City Hacks, at Queen's University. HackClock is an alarm clock for Android that encourages the user to wake up on time by shutting off only when the user has solved a small programming challenge. Gone are the days where you snooze for five minutes only to find out three hours have passed and you have basically missed your entire morning.

## From the team
This app is still very much a work in progress as we only had twelve hours during the hackathon to build this from scratch. However, we are proud of it for placing us in third for the hackathon, and we will continue to develop this at least until a minimum viable product level has been accomplished.

### TODO (Tentative)
1. Fix the ~1 minute delay that occurs for the alarm system.
2. Determine how to actually execute user inputted code instead of comparing user input with the answer.
3. Improve the GUI (Lots that can be done here).
4. Possibly edit this repo to only have source code and no Android Studio IDE specific files.
