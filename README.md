# Sleep In

An interactive alarm clock application that prompts the user with programming challenges that they must solve in order to shut off the alarm. 

The motivation for this application is that users can get up and shut off their alarm without being aware that they are doing so. The purpose of this is to engage the users' brain in order to fully wake them up before being able to shut off the alarm so that they do not fall back asleep and miss their bus, be late for work, or just sleep in too late.
